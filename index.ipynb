    "Do we use the entire vocabulary, or just limit the model to a subset of the most frequently used words? If so, how many?\n",
    "Do we engineer other features, such as bigrams, or POS tags, or Mutual Information Scores?\n",
    "What sort of vectorization should we use in our model? Boolean Vectorization? Count Vectorization? TF-IDF? More advanced vectorization strategies such as Word2Vec?"
